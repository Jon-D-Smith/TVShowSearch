# TVShowSearch
Working with the TVMaze api and Axios

The API I use in this project is found at: https://www.tvmaze.com/api

This web app is a serverless web app using the TVMaze api. When you put in a string it pulls up to the top ten matches and gives you information on the shows including the title, picture, summary, and genres. When entering in a new search term it will wipe out the previous results and give you a fresh page of results.

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- The Axios Library
- CSS Flex

Features I'm proud of:
- The site is built with the SPA principle
- Looping through and presenting the genres regardless of the amoung returned from the API
- Truncating the Summaries in pure JS
